# Federated Research

Federated Research is a collection of research projects in [Federated Learning (FL)](https://ai.googleblog.com/2017/04/federated-learning-collaborative.html) and [Federated Analytics (FA)](https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/05/federated-analytics-collaborative-data.html).
FL is an approach to machine learning where a shared global model is trained across
many participating clients that keep their training data locally. FA is a practice of applying data science methods to the analysis of raw data that is stored locally on usersâ€™ devices.

Most of the research projects are developed with
[TensorFlow Federated (TFF)](https://www.tensorflow.org/federated), which is an
open-source framework for machine learning and other computations on
decentralized data.
[TFF for research](https://www.tensorflow.org/federated/tff_for_research) is an
overview.
