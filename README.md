# Federated Research

Federated Research is a collection of research projects related to
[Federated Learning](https://ai.googleblog.com/2017/04/federated-learning-collaborative.html)
and
[Federated Analytics](https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/05/federated-analytics-collaborative-data.html).
Federated learning is an approach to machine learning where a shared global
model is trained across many participating clients that keep their training data
locally. Federated analytics is the practice of applying data science methods to
the analysis of raw data that is stored locally on usersâ€™ devices.

Many of the projects contained in this repository use
[TensorFlow Federated (TFF)](https://www.tensorflow.org/federated), an
open-source framework for machine learning and other computations on
decentralized data. For an overview and introduction to TFF, please see the
[list of tutorials](https://www.tensorflow.org/federated/tutorials/federated_learning_for_image_classification).
For information on using TFF for research, see
[TFF for research](https://www.tensorflow.org/federated/tff_for_research).
